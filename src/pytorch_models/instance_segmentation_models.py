        The behavior of the model changes depending if it is in training or evaluation mode.
        During training, the model expects both the input tensors and targets.
        The model returns a dictionary during training, containing the classification and regression losses for both the RPN and the R-CNN.
        During evaluation, the model requires only the input tensors, and returns the post-processed predictions as a list of dictionaries, one for each input image.

        Parameters
        ----------
        images [torch.Tensor of shape (batch_size, depth, height, width)]: Input tensors
        targets (list of batch_size dicts or None):
        Dictionaries contain:
            - masks [torch.FloatTensor of shape (n_objects, height, width)]: Segmentation masks
            - boxes [torch.FloatTensor of shape (n_objects, 4)]: Bounding boxes in VOC format
            - labels [torch.Int64Tensor of shape (n_objects)]: Labels of objects
            - image_id [torch.Int64Tensor of shape (1)]: Image identifier used during evaluation
            - area [torch.FloatTensor of shape (n_objects)]: Areas of the bounding boxes
            - iscrowd [torch.UInt8Tensor of shape (n_objects)]: Instances with iscrowd=True will be ignored during evaluation

        Returns
        -------
        During training:
            (dict): Dictionary of losses at current training step
            Dictionary contains:
                - loss_classifier [torch.Tensor of shape (1)]: Loss of the classifier that classifies detected objects into classes
                - loss_box_reg [torch.Tensor of shape (1)]: Loss of the bounding box regressor
                - loss_box_mask [torch.Tensor of shape (1)]: Loss of the mask
                - loss_objectness [torch.Tensor of shape (1)]: Loss of the classifier that classifies if a bounding box is an object of interest or background
                - loss_rpn_box_reg [torch.Tensor of shape (1)]: Loss of the bounding box regressor for the region proposal network
        During evaluation:
            (list): Predictions (list of dictionaries) of the model for each image
            Dictionary contains:
                - boxes [torch.FloatTensor of shape (n_detections, 4)]: Predicted bounding boxes in PASCAL VOC format
                - labels [torch.Int64Tensor of shape (n_detections)]: Predicted class labels of bounding boxes
                - scores [torch.Tensor of shape (n_detections)]: Confidence scores of predicted bounding boxes
                - masks [torch.FloatTensor of shape (n_detections, n_instance, height, width)]: Predicted logits of instance masks
